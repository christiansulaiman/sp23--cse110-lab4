1. It will output 3 in the console because i is dependent on the size of the array that is passed in, which in this case is of length 3.
2. It will output 150 in the console because in the last iteration of i, i = 2. prices[2] = 300 and since the discount is 0.5, discountedPrice = 300 * 0.5 = 150.
3. It will output 150 in the console because in the last iteration of i, i = 2. prices[2] = 300 and since the discount is 0.5, discountedPrice = 300 * 0.5 = 150. Next, finalPrice is the value of rounding 150 * 100 / 100 = 150.
4. This function will return an array with the modified values of the prices array. In this case, it will return the array: [50, 100, 150] because of the algorithm still working.
5. It will return an error because i is in block scope and so it is out of scope when called in line 12.
6. It will return an error because discountedPrice is in block scope and so it is out of scope when called in line 13.
7. It will output 150 in the console because finalPrice is still in scope.
8. This function will return an array with the modified values of the prices array. In this case, it will return the array: [50, 100, 150] because of the algorithm still working.
9. It will return an error because i is in block scope and so it is out of scope when called in line 11.
10. It will output 3 in the console because the length of the input array is 3 and it is in scope.
11. This function will return an array with the modified values of the prices array. In this case, it will return the array: [50, 100, 150] because of the algorithm still working.

15. == compares 2 variables while ignoring the variable's datatype, === compares 2 variables but takes into consideration its' datatype.
16. 
17. It returns the array [2,4,6]. In line 3, the algorithm will modify each element of the input array by using the callback to the doSomething function. Since the doSomething function multiplies any parameter's value by 2, the final array that is returned will be [2,4,6].
